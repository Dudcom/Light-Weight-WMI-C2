.SYNOPSIS
    Configures Windows Firewall to block all network traffic except HTTPS, LDAP, IMAP, DNS, and SMB.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script sets the default inbound and outbound firewall policies to block all traffic.
    It then creates specific allow rules for HTTPS, LDAP, IMAP, DNS, and SMB traffic on all IP addresses.

.NOTES
    - Run this script with administrative privileges.
    - Backup your current firewall settings before running this script.
    - Test the script in a non-production environment before deploying it widely.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Configure-Firewall-Allow-Specific-Services.ps1

# Ensure the script is run as Administrator
if (-not ([Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal][Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent()).IsInRole("Administrator")) {
